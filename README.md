# SCU Double Dips

- Hey SCU Engineers! Do you ever feel confused as to which courses to take if you need to fill out university cores as well as major requirements? Well look no further - this little program obtains data from the CourseAvail API and can outputs the latest quarter's double dip classes via CSV file format for easy viewing. It can also pull data from previous quarters as well.

## Future Updates (Coming Very Soon): 

- Make it with a Python GUI for easy access and for users to download locally as exe. Make it dynamic with computer notifications allowing refreshing very 20, 40, and 60 seconds to update seats which change pretty often. 

- UI should use colored tags, filtering A-Z, and overall use SCU's color palette. Maybe convert from CSV to PDF format and make the TKinter GUI a PDF viewer opposed to rendering large amounts of CSV data (e.g. onwards of about 4,300 entries!) within the GUI itself.
