# SCU Double Dips
 A simple program to get double dip courses at SCU. 

This was created very quickly late at night in an attempt to play with Python's syntax. I also needed to quickly find a list of Double Dip courses while working on my four year plan. This is by no means a great implementation, but hey, it works.
